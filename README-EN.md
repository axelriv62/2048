## Presentation

This project was realized out as part of a Practical Work (TP) in the second semester of the BUT in Computer Science at the IUT of Lens

The main objective was to familiarize oneself with the development of human-machine interfaces (IHM) through the design of a 2048 game, using the JavaFX framework.

<br>

## Objectives

As part of this project, the various objectives were:

- Use SceneBuilder to design a graphical user interface and place components on it.
- Write the code for a complex controller, using attributes injected by JavaFX and methods associated with the `onAction` property of a button.
- Programmatically add simple components and associated actions from the controller's code.
- Implement interactions between your own classes and the applicationâ€™s controller.

<br>

## Areas for Improvement

The project is complete in the context of the TP, but it can still be improved. Here are some improvement tracks:

+ Improve the graphical interface to offer a better user experience, especially on the background.
+ Add visual animations to make the game more interactive and dynamic, such as tile sliding.
